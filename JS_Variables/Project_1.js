// Variables are containers for storing data:
// In JS Variables can be declared in 4 ways: automatically, Using Var, Using let and Using const:

// Let variables:
/* Variables declared with let have Block Scope.
 * They can't be accessed outside of the block where they are defined.
 * They can't be redeclared or reassigned within the same block.
 */

let name = "Bikash";
console.log(name); // Output: Bikash



// Const variables:
/** 
 Variablesdefined with const cannot be Redeclared
 variables defined with const cannot be reassigned
 Variables defined with const have Block Scope.



 // When to use JavaScript Const?
 - Use consst when you declare:
        - A new Array
        - A new Object
        - A new Function
        - A new RegExp

const age = 25;
console.log(age); // Output: 25




// Var variables:
var Name = "BIkash";
console.log(Name); // Output: Bikash

/* 
variables with var can be redeclared or reassigned
variables with var can have global scope
